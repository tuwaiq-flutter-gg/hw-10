# Homework 10

In this exercise you will develop a class of shapes to write a program that computes the area of each shape for different objects. The hierarchy will consist of a superclass class called `Shape` with three derived classes (Choose three different shapes ex: circle, cylinder ...etc). Do the following.

1. Write a superclass `Shape` with the following properties: An instance variable `shapeName` of type String, an abstract method `area()`,
`toString` method that returns the name of the shape.

2. Using Inheritance and Polymorphism means and create three classes for each shape, write the formula of each one inside its class, using `area()` method.

3. call the three shapes you create in the main and test it.
